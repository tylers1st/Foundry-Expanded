<h1>Auto Script Reader</h1>

  
  
  
<p>This is a macro made for reading prewritten script off of a journal.</p>
<p>All you have to do is write a journal with a unique name, write out the names of the tokens with lines in the format
<br>"{Example Name}:"<br>
and move to a new line after that. Keep in mind that the token name and the name in the journal must be exactly the same, case sensitive.</p>
